The main focus of this project was the create an Android Studio application that could be used as a closet organizer. 

The main components of our project are as follows: 

* expandable list to allow for simple choice selection by user 
* Java OpenCV and computer vision to identify image contours and crop items from their backgrounds
* drag and drop options for the user in different components of one screen
